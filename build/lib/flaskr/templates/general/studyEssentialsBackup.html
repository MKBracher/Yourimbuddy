               so make sure you’ve got your dates and times locked in, then plan your study based on that information.<br>
             As for the best ways to study for exams, UON’s Centre for Teaching and Learning has some handy pointers:<br>

               <h5>Memory Aids</h5>
               The University of Newcastle has an open book policy for exams. Except for some exemptions, the memory aid is the
               minimum allowed for exams, but some courses will allow for more than the memory aid.
               Always check your course outlines so that you know exactly what you can bring into each exam.
               <br>Unless stated otherwise, a memory aid is 1 x A4 double-sided sheet of any type of notes, handwritten or
               otherwise. It can be on coloured paper and can contain diagrams.
               <br>What to bring:
               <li>Most importantly, your Student ID, Driver's License or passport to all exams</li>
               <li>Pens or pencils</li>
               <li>Erasers</li>
               <li>A clear water bottle</li>
               <li>Tissues</li>
